COMS327-Assignment 1.07: Parsing monster definition

To execute the code, run the following commands:

1)To load a file

make
./rlg327


This project has Fog of war disabled for debugging and testing purposes. Without the fog of war,
it monsters behave exaclty as if the fog was implmented.

This project was completed in C++, using multiple user defined functions.
This code reads a file and parses it to display the monster and object descriptions

I have also designed this project to work similar to the previous assignments,
but reverting back to srtucts and using previous codes as guidance.
