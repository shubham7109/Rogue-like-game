COMS327-Assignment 1.05: User Interface with Ncurses

To execute the code, run the following commands:

1)To only generate a new dungeon

make
./rlg327

2)To load 10 number of monsters:

make
./rlg327 --nummon 10


This project was completed in C, using multiple user defined functions. It uses the nCurses library to display the rendered dungeon.
This project also allows the player character to navigate across the dungeon. Also it lets the user scroll through a list of monsters on pressing the 'm' key.
