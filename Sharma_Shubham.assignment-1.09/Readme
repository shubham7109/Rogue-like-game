COMS327-Assignment 1.08: PC Equipment and Updated Combat
To execute the code, run the following commands:

1)To load a file

make
./rlg327


This project allowes to user to use the object agains the monster (finally!) :)

MAKE SURE TO run the terminal maximized, as it prints off the screen from the default terminal size. 

The project was mostly codeded using modes.cpp and modes.h. It heavily implements io queue as I found it pretty helpful for debugging purposes.
Please be patient and there are a lot of messages, but all the instructions should all be on scree to help out. The project was tested for errors
and none were found.


For any problems, please contact: shubham@iastate.edu
