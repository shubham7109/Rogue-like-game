COMS327-Assignment 1.06: "Fog of War‚Äù and porting to C++

To execute the code, run the following commands:

1)To only generate a new dungeon

make
./rlg327

2)To load 10 number of monsters:

make
./rlg327 --nummon 10


This project was completed in C, using multiple user defined functions. Majority of the code now runs on C++ which is a big conversion step from C.
Also, now the PC only lights a room of 3x3 by toggling f. The PC also has a functionality to teleport using g randomly, or using t to teleport to a custom location.
