Introduction:
	This program is the second part of a big project that we are going to build this semester.
	In this assignment, we draw the dungeon map with random rooms on it and corridor to travel between rooms.
	This program generate, save, and load so the dungeon is not a good looking, but this is 
	the basic code to build the game.
Functions:
	There are 8 functions that are essential for this program, which are listed below:
 	void dungeon_initial(void); initalized te dungeon
	void dungeon_display(void); display teh dungeon
	int check_tile(int x, int w, int y, int h); check the tiles
	void add_dungeon_room(void);	add the rooms
	void draw_corridor(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2); draw the corridor
	void add_corridor(void); add the corridor
	int add_hardness(void);	 add the hardness
	void dungeon_drwaing();	draw the dungeon

Note: 
compile: make
rum: ./assign102 (type or more)- new/save/load
