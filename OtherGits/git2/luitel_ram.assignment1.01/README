Introduction:
	This program is the first part of a big project that we are going to build this semester.
	In this assignment, we draw the dungeon map with random rooms on it and corridor to travel between rooms.
	This program is to draw the dungeon using ASCII art, so the dungeon is not a good looking, but this is 
	the basic code to build the game.
Functions:
	There are 5 functions that are essential for this program, which are listed below:
 		generate_map: This function will draw first dungeon map
		draw_map: This funciton will draw final dungeon map
		create_room: This function will generate random room
		updateRoomOnMap: This funciton is used to draw all the rooms on the  dungeon
		room_connect:Finally this function will connect all the rooms that are being created.
		

Note: 
compile: make
rum: ./assign1.01
