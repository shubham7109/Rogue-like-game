This is an implementation of Assignment 1.07. It correctly opens an existing monster_desc.txt file from the home directory, and parses the information. It uses identifies such as BEGIN MONSTER, COLOR etc.. to identify when a specific type of value will be encountered. After each monster is parsed, it is printed to the screen, but if there is an error parsing a monster, the program will exit and print an error message.
