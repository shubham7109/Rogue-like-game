	This is the third part of the big program(game) we are develoing this semester in this class.
	This program will calculate and find a shortest path from monster to character for both non-tunnel and 		tunnel monsters. The program will also draw distance map for both monster and using number from 0-9 to 		show how far the distance is. 
	
	Among the three part so far this is the logest  and I would say hardest part so far. This program need 
	some good code writing skill and ideas about he algorithem. Some of the algoritem used are Dijkstra's 		algorithm, and Binaryheap. Dijkstra algorithem takes lot time to corretly work for me.

Note:
compile: Makefile
rum: ./assign103
graph representation:
	1. Random map (@ character represent character)
	2. Distance map 
	3. Tunnel map
