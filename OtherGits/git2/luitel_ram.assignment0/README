Mosts of the work is done in main function. There are two functions one checkLives which
check either a cell is live or not and another is countLives which count how many of the 
cell are lives. I have used struct to represent symbol and the liveness of the cell. The 
most of the code is simple and self explaintory. 

Note: 
compile: type " make" and enter
run: type" ./assign0 indexes"
     example-  ./assign0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9
