My code follows all the assignment specifications except for in one place. NPCs and objects are now created by by taking a random monster or object description for each monster or object created. These have all of the attributes listed in the description files. My one error is coming by means of a memory leak with the name and description fields of npc. I tried for hours but could not figure this out. Program runs perfectly without these fields though, so I'm not sure what is going on. As for color, it is pretty straightforward, I just use the first color for the monster or object color using attron and attroff. For smaller requirements, I load 20 objects into the dungeon, characters can move over them, etc.
