My program's main is very simple, consisting of a few switches which are handled in if-else statements. I have one for save (--SAVE), one for load (--LOAD), one for loading a specific dungeon (--LOAD 01.rlg327(, one for both (--SAVE --LOAD), and a default which generates a random dungeon and doesn't save it. Also, if there are any weird switches or arguments it will go to default. I have two functions, one to read a dungeon file and one to write one. To read, I get the size of the file, the hardness for each space, and the room information. From there I plot the hardness, checking for zero and writing a # to those locations. I then go through my list of rooms and plot them in the previously hashed spaces. I then print the dungeon. For writing I put the identifier at the beginning as well as the version number. I then calculate the size quickly and write that to the next 4 bytes. Hardness is done in the same way, going through the generated dungeon and writing hardness values to an integer array. Finally, I find all rooms by looking for upper-left corners and create a list of room statistics. I write both hardness and room locations to the file to finish the function.
