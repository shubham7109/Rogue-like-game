kThe two features I implemented for this assignment was new terrain types which affect the PC and ranged attacks. The new terrain types are water and lava, represented with red and blue ! characters, respectively. The water cuts the players speed in half and the lava damages the player by 50hp per move in the terrain type (both of these queue a message each turn). For ranged combat, I have a spell that you can cast by pressing s then entering in the character of the monster you want to target. This sends a projectile to it and affects any other npc in the immediate area (and has a cool animation). The second type is if the user has a ranged weapon equipped. The command a followed again by the character you want to target and the projectile will be sent and the damage inflicted on the npc.
