In my code there's one main data structure which is the dungeon data type, made with structs for a dungeon space (which has attributes if material and hardness). First I populate the dunegon material with spaces and hardness with random variables. I then go and generate 18 rooms in the dungeon through a simple for loop,which check several conditions based on randomly generated placement locations and dimensions. If the random placement location and dimension passes the room is written to the dungeon boaard and added to an array of rooms. After the rooms are generated I pass the rooms through to a connection function. The connection function checks all previously connected rooms for the closest one and draws a corridor there using a simple function which checks rock hardness and determines a direction accordingly. Finally, after corridos are written the dungeon is printed and the program ends.
