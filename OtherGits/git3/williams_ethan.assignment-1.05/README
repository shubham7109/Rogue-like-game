My code is implemented in the pc_next_move() function of pc.c. I have a loop that runs continually until the function call inside returns a 1 (a valid pc move in this case). Inside that function call I get a character from the user and have a switch set up to do something different based on the input. The keys specified for movement are pretty straightforward. These will change the values of the pair_t dir. I also have options for the > and < keys, which will create a new dungeon for the pc is they were standing on the stairs. The L command takes the position of the pc (used later for repositioning the view) and gets another character. An escape returns to control mode and recenters view on pc. Otherwise a function is called which updates where the view is.These are according to the assignment spec, and the dungeon is rerendered centered on the new location. Back to the original function, the last key is Q, which clears the memory and aborts the program, effectively quitting the game. Another part of the assignment spec was doing the view with ncurses. This wasn't too bad, basically I take 40 characters on either side of the pc, 11 above and 10 below to make an 80x21 window. Each time this is rendered it centers on the pc again since it always draws based on pc location.
