The first part of the assignment spec is to convert all C files to C++. I conveted all of my code to C++ format, made clean, and compiled. From here I dealt with errors in each file, mostly casts in malloc and assorted issues like that. For the second part of the assignment, the parsing, I have that all functional. There is a ifstream which reads the txt file line by line. I store all of the necessary fields in a struct at the beginning of the file. While I'm going through the txt file I check for duplicates and lines in the description over 77 characters. This sets a flag variable. Before I print, I check if any field in the struct is blank or if the flag is set, and if so I discard the monster (don't print it). If every one of those checks clear I print everything off in order (name, symbol, etc.) and move to the next monster, stopping when I get to the end of the file.
