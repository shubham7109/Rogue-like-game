Assignment 1.07: Parsing Monster Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this assignment we had to parse a monster description file (2 samples were given to us). The parsing as been fully implemented and all code is within 
rlg327.cpp. Once the parse function is called I return 0 and we do not generate a dungeon and play the game as Dr. Sheaffer mentioned in the assignment
pdf, "I suggest that you modify main to read the monster description files, print the test output, and exit, without ever entering the game proper". 
This assignment works according to specs. To run do the following commands in terminal 
make clobber 
make 
./rlg327
MAKE SURE THE monsters_desc.txt FILE IS IN THE $HOME/.rlg327 folder. I have included Dr. Sheaffer's test monsters_desc.txt file inside my tar if needed for 
testing.
