My code accomplishes all of the necessary requirements of the assignment. The i and e keys pull up the inventory and equipment menus, respectively. In the inventory menu, the w, d, x, and I keys all work as specified in the assignment, and if any other key is pushed you exit the menu. The same thing is true for the equipment menu except that the only option is to take off the object. As far as speed, upon equipment of an object the speed is added to the player and when it is taken off this value is subtracted. For damage by the PC I go through all items and add them to the damage the PC has by default. For monsters I just roll their damage dice. Attacks happen as specified in the assignment, with damage being subtracted from hitpoints and the character dying upon reaching or going below zero. Finally, when an npc tries to move into the space of another npc, the npc simply moves there and the original occupant is moved into the space where the first npc was to begin with.
