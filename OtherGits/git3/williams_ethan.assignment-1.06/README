My code successfully makes character, pc, and npc into C++ classes and most of the structure of the code is correct. The code uses accessor and mutator methods to access and alter many parts of the objects I made classes for. All of the files needing access to these fields were changed to get access through these accessors and mutators. Despite having everything converted I am getting linker issues for some reason and could not figure them out, so my program does not compile completely and cannot run correctly. As for fog of war, this part works perfectly (I have the commit saved on GitHub that is functional outside of the incorrect code in the tarball). Whenever the pc moves the 5 spaces are added to the visible map which is then consulted before printing in io.c.
